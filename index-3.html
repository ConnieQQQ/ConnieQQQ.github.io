<body><h1>The structure of a dog's ear
</h1>
<P1>


It has an auditory capacity of 120,000 Hertz, 16 times greater than a human, and can hear about 400 times farther than a human. Dogs were also twice as good at detecting sound directions as humans, picking out 32. It can distinguish between a metronome that vibrates 96 or 100 times per minute, 133 or 144. Dogs can build up a conditioned response to human commands and simple language based on changes in tone and syllable.

    Dogs can hear 40,000 cycles. The sound collected by the big ear, through the external auditory canal vibrates the tympanic membrane, and even vibrates the small bone of the middle ear, to the lymphatic fluid of the inner ear, and then to the brain by the auditory nerve. Dogs can distinguish very small or high frequency sounds (ultrasonic). The ability to judge the sound source is also very strong. When a dog hears a sound, it can see all the way and hear all the way because of the sympathetic interaction between the ear and the eye. At night, even when it sleeps, it maintains a high level of alertness and can distinguish sounds up to a kilometer away. It is important to note that there is no need to shout at the dog. A loud voice or sound is an adverse stimulus to the dog, which may cause him to feel pain, panic or panic. </p3>
