Dogs of the lens is twice as thick, its adjustment ability of the eye only 1/5 ~ 1/3, and people can see within 50 m, but more than this distance can't see, but the goal of sports can see 825 m distance, and it is a very broad field of vision, monocular vision for around 100 ° ~ 125 °, the top view of 50 ° ~ 70 °, the vision of 30 ° ~ 60 °, in front of the object on which the most clear but due to the dog's head rotation is very flexible, so basically can do "all eyes and all ears. Dogs can only see 25 degrees with one eye, so they can't see the closest distance from the front. Dog's eyeball lens is relatively large, like a horse's eyeball deformation, so can not adjust the sense of near and far, 20 to 30 meters is about its limit. Dogs have special ability to detect moving objects; They can detect up to 70 lines per second, compared with about 60 lines per second for a typical TV picture. Dogs can see better in low light than we can. Dogs are natural predators that survive by hunting, so they can see fairly well in the dark. Dogs' eyes can see colour at short wavelengths. In addition, dogs' corneas are larger, allowing more light to enter their eyes, making it easier to see in dim areas.

    <p3>Human and canine vision differs in its response to light. The human eye responds to the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) that give rise to various colors. Dr. DennisBrooks, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, said that dog vision is different from human vision. Dogs can't distinguish colors as humans can. Dogs can distinguish between shades of blue, indigo, and purple, but have no special sensitivity to the high-intensity colors of the spectrum, such as red and green. Dr Brooks's research shows that red is dark to dogs and green is white to dogs, so green grass looks white to dogs.</p3>
